# README

This document provides an overview of multiple Python programs contained within a single file. Each program addresses a different aspect of computer vision and facial recognition using various libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and face_recognition.

## Programs:

### Program 1: Take Photo and Save
- **Description:** This program captures a photo using the default camera and saves it with the user's name as the filename.
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, tkinter
- **Usage:** Execute the Python script and click the "Capture Photo" button. Enter your name when prompted, and the photo will be saved in the "images" folder.

### Program 2: Faces's Counter
- **Description:** This program provides a graphical interface for real-time face recognition for count the number of faces using OpenCV and the face_recognition library.
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, face_recognition, tkinter
- **Usage:** Run the script and click the "Exit" button to close the application. Detected faces will be outlined with green rectangles.

### Program 3: Simple Face Recognition
- **Description:** This Python class provides a simple interface for face recognition using the face_recognition library and OpenCV.
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, face_recognition, numpy
- **Usage:** Import the SimpleFacerec and main classes into your Python script and run the class main.

### Program 4: Facial and Hand Landmark Detection
- **Description:** This script detects facial and hand landmarks in real-time using the MediaPipe library.
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, MediaPipe
- **Usage:** Run the script and press 'q' to exit the application. Facial landmarks are displayed in red, while hand landmarks are displayed in green.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- MediaPipe library
- face_recognition library
- Tkinter library (for some programs)
- NumPy library (for some programs)

## Installation:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install required libraries using pip:

## Usage:
. Run each program individually by executing the respective Python scripts.

## Notes:
- Ensure that your computer has a working camera accessible by the programs requiring video input.
- Adjust the code and parameters as needed for your specific use case or environment.
